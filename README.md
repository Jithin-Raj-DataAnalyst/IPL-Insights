## Methods

The performance of batters can be identified using a unified measure known as batting rate. This measure can be calculated by assigning reward points to the player based on different criteria. Those are listed in the immediate tables. The bowling rate also can be calculated using the same procedure.

Whereas, the performance of the allrounders can be determined by deriving a new  measure from both batting as well as bowling measures. The formula for the allrounder rate measure is:

Allrounder rating = (Batting rate * Bowling rate) /1000
